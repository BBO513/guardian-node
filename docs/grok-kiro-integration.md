Phishing is like digital fishing - bad actors use fake 'bait' (emails, texts, websites) to 'catch' your personal information.

**Common Phishing Examples:**
1. **Fake Bank Emails** - 'Your account is locked, click here to unlock'
2. **Prize Scams** - 'You've won! Just enter your details to claim'
3. **Urgent Messages** - 'Your account expires today, act now!'
4. **Fake Tech Support** - 'Your computer is infected, call this number'

**Family Protection Strategies:**
- **Stop and Think** - If it seems urgent or too good to be true, it probably is
- **Verify Independently** - Contact companies directly using official numbers
- **Check URLs Carefully** - Look for misspellings or suspicious domains
- **Never Give Personal Info** - Legitimate companies won't ask for passwords via email

**Practice Activity:** Guardian Node suggests creating a family game where you identify phishing attempts together, making it educational rather than scary for children."
