**Technical Footnotes:**
1. **Offline Operation**: Utilizes local GGUF models² via llama-cpp-python with airgap capability³ and hard-blocked internet by default
2. **Modular LLM Support**: Compatible with SecureBERT, Mistral 7B, Dolphin, and other GGUF-format models with configurable context length and temperature
3. **Airgap Logic**: Physical network cutoff capability with comprehensive network request blocking and audit logging
4. **Skills Architecture**: Built on Guardian Interpreter's modular skill system where each cybersecurity function is a loadable Python module with standardized run() entry points
