# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Guardian Node project currently lacks standardized authentication methods that comply with modern security practices. This feature aims to implement secure authentication methods across the project, ensuring all authentication uses Personal Access Tokens (PATs), SSH keys, or passkeys instead of password-based authentication. This aligns with GitHub's removal of password authentication in 2021 and enhances the overall security posture of the Guardian Node system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Guardian Node developer, I want to use secure authentication methods for repository access, so that I can maintain the security integrity of the project while following modern best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer attempts to authenticate with the repository THEN the system SHALL only accept PAT, SSH keys, or passkeys.
2. WHEN a developer reads the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for setting up each authentication method.
3. IF a developer attempts to use password authentication THEN the system SHALL reject the attempt and guide them to secure alternatives.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Guardian Node user, I want clear documentation on secure authentication methods, so that I can properly set up and use the system without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the README.md file THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive instructions for all supported authentication methods.
2. WHEN a user follows the authentication setup instructions THEN the system SHALL ensure they can successfully authenticate without using passwords.
3. IF a user is on Windows, Linux, or macOS THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific authentication instructions.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Guardian Node administrator, I want to verify that all authentication methods are secure and password-free, so that I can ensure compliance with security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator reviews the codebase THEN the system SHALL demonstrate that no password-based authentication is present.
2. WHEN an administrator runs tests THEN the system SHALL verify that all authentication methods work correctly in offline mode.
3. IF an authentication method fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting steps.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Guardian Node contributor, I want to understand the authentication workflow, so that I can efficiently contribute to the project without security-related delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contributor clones the repository THEN the system SHALL guide them through secure authentication setup.
2. WHEN a contributor pushes changes THEN the system SHALL validate their authentication method is secure.
3. IF a contributor needs to update their authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL provide a clear process for doing so.
